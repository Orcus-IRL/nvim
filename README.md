The old folder consists of my first configuration, that I created from scratch by watching Typecraft neovim series(nicely done) and then 
I just wanted to see how theprimeagen setup feels like, so I switched it for a few days felt solid,
now this final init.lua is going to be my configuration file and I'm gonna keep configuring it and updating it, btw this init.lua file is from kickstartnvim(such a neat and clean starup guide).

Enjoy configurating
