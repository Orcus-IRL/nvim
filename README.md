This right here is my old and new neovim configuration,

The new configuration is exactly like @ThePrimeagen but with the which key plugin, so you can customize it however you want

The old configuration is the only I created completely from scratch by watching typecraft neovim series(clean and nice series btw).

Enjoy configurating...
