The old1 folder consists of my first configuration(from kick startnvim), that I modified a little based on my preferences.
I just wanted to see how theprimeagen setup feels like, so I switched it for a few days felt solid,

this init.lua will be my final configuration, would change someof the plugins, but I will keep this because I made it from scratch by watching typecraft nvim series, so I'm very comfortable with this, sometimes you gotta try different things to make something your own, you know what I mean

Enjoy configurating
