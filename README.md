# Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository! This project showcases my journey in customizing Neovim using Lua.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- `init.lua`: My final custom Neovim configuration.
- `lua/`: Directory containing Lua modules used in the configuration.
- `old1/`: Initial configurations based on Kickstart.nvim.
- `theprimeagen/`: Contains configurations inspired by ThePrimeagen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the latest version of Neovim installed. You can install Neovim from the [official website](https://neovim.io/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Orcus-IRL/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. **Install Plugins**:
    Open Neovim and run:
    ```vim
    :PackerSync
    ```

3. **Launch Neovim**:
    ```sh
    nvim
    ```

## Structure

- `init.lua`: Entry point for Neovim configuration.
- `lua/`: Contains custom Lua scripts and modules.
- `old1/`: Previous configuration setups based on Kickstart.nvim.
- `theprimeagen/`: Configurations inspired by ThePrimeagen's setup.

## Customization

You can customize the configuration by editing the files in the `lua/` directory and `init.lua`. Make sure to reload Neovim after making changes.
